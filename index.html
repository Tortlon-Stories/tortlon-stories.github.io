<p style="text-align:center">
Stories from a place that doesn't exist.. This site is dedicated to TES4 Oblivion fictions from NotGod and others that wish to submit their fictions here. This is also a longue for learning how to write your own literature. If you wish to submit your story here. Contact NotGodOkay via DeviantArt and perhaps other places.<br>
And remember.</p><p style="color:red;text-align:center">18+ is a thing! This site is gonna feature explicit stories as well so look for a 18+ on the link to your selected story.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">
What is allowed here that I can submit? As said, this place allows 18+ rated literature as the person behind it is a fetish artist. This site allows fan literature, OC stories, canon character stories like telling their history or shipping characters, what if stories, modern or future stories and crossovers stories from other TES games. But the prime game is Oblivion, the 4th installment. What is not allowe is crossovers from other game series or from other media, pedophilia, extreme fetish stories and hate stories. These are the rules for submission. Send NotGod your story privatelly or show him an already public fanfic so he can consider letting it in.<br>
A story will have it's own page. The whole story is gonna be there visible from a single page with chapters and your imagery. If you consider wanting to donate one to the site that is.<br>
