<p>In the great Imperial City Market District was a whole bunch of people going back and worth to purchase some random shit. A crazy lady said "Back here live at the Imperial City we're here with our awesome friend Bugak the Orc zombie." The little undead Bugak-Gro bal looked like shit and the crazy Imperial lady continued "Bugak you're looking good Bugak you got an awesome face paint Bugak. Bugak what do you think?"<br>
<br>
Bugak looked at the lady "I like Mudcrabs!" And the crazy lady said "Alright you're a huge scumbag to society really good!" And the kid Bugak was never the same.<br>
<br>
26 years later. Bugak owned a book store in Leyawiin where he constantly get offended by other Orcs. One day he said to one of his customers "OOOOHH! I'm Bugak-Gro bal!"
